My first programming challenge at the start of my time in my university. Made in 2018 but uploaded on github in 2021. 

Follow these steps to run:

-Open Project Submission file.

-Download Asteroids Project.zip file and unzip it.

-You will get a file called Asteroids-Windows. Open that file.

-Run Asteroids.sln in Visual Studio. 

Note: The code files within that unzipped file wil be found in hw0-windows inside Asteroids-Windows. If you want to access them directly on github without downloading anything, you can do so by opening Asteroids-Game-OOP/Project Submission/Final Submission/Project Files/
